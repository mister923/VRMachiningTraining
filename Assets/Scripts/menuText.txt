%% Work Coordinate System Alignment
Note: The following Work Coordinate System uses a Edge Finder.
Learning Objective: Given the milling machine, fixtures, stock, and endmill, and edgefinder:  Establish an X & Y axis origin in alignment with the stock. The accuracy of the origin should be within .001” in.
The edgefinder is used to precisely indicate off the stock and locate the edges of the stock. 
The probe is the lower, movable portion of the tool. This edgefinder is placed in a tool holder for use.
Let's begin the process of aligning the coordinate systems. 
Identify the Work Coordinate System that is being used in the CAM program.
The origin used in the CAM program MUST match the coordinate system that we define on the stock material.
Place the edge finder in a collet or chuck
Place edge finder into machine
Place edge finder into machine
Offset the edge finder to have the probe rotate off-center
Turn the spindle on and run between 500-1000 RPM
Move the work piece and approach the side of the stock that is collinear with the X axis.
Slowly continue to move the edge finder to the side of the stock. As the probe and stock contact, the rotation will appear more concentric.
Continue very incrementally (.0005” ) until the edge finder probe pops out of concentricity.
Set the X axis location to be ½ the diameter of the probe offset from 0. 

%% Tool Offset
&&& Tool Setter

Note: The toolsetter is a specialized measurement tool and is calibrated to measure the distance from the bottom of the tool setter to the top of the pressure measurement pad.
Place the desired end mill in the collet and affix the drawbar to clamp the endmill.
Place the tool setter on the top of the stock in a stable, flat region.
Calibrate the tool setter following the included instructions. The tool setter should read 0.000” when it is extended a total distance of 2.000”, from the base of the tool setter to the pressure pad.
Lower the tool until the pressure pad of the tool setter and the endmill are just touching.
Very slowly (.001” increments) lower the tool (CNC) until the tool depresses the tool setter until it reads 0.000” or a value slightly under.
Zero the axis when the tool offsetter reads 0.000.
Alternatively, set the Z position by entering the value after G92. G92 is the G-code command for setting axis position.

&&& Paper Method
Step 1.
Place a piece of printer paper on top of the stock.
Step 2.
Lower the tool very slowly onto the paper. Move the paper back and forth constantly
Step 3.
Continue lowering the tool until you are unable to move the paper. The tool should snag on the paper.
Step 4.
Raise the tool .001” or very gradually until the paper can move again.
Step 5.
Set the Z position to be .005" (thickness of the paper)


%% Fixturing

The fixturing process will vary for each part. Different sizes & shapes of parts will have different requirements.
A vice is the most common form of fixturing.
A vice can be used and adjusted for a wide range of stock. 
First, clean the vice of any oil or metal chips. 
Place square stock in the center of the vice. 
If the stock does not clear the top of the vice, parralels can be used to elevate the stock. 
Alternate fixturing may be required for more complex parts. For example:<br> \u2022 Circular Stock <br> \u2022 Perimeter Needs To Be Machined <br> \u2022 Large Stock



There are three common requirements for all fixtures::<br> \u2022 1. Sufficient clamping force:<br> \u2022 2. Will not collide with the tool:<br> \u2022 3. Fixture provides access to area being machined.
For repetitive machining, efficient processes are very important. A vice stop can be used to maintain a similar reference point. 
% Error Management

%% Work Coordinate System Errors

Incorrect Corner Reference
<b> Error: </b> The work coordinate system was established on the wrong corner of the part
<b> Consequence: </b> <br><align="left"> \u2022 Tool crashes with fixture  <br> \u2022 Tool breaks  <br> \u2022 Fixture is machine  <br> \u2022 Machine cuts air  <br> \u2022 No tool engagement
<b>Mitigation:</b> <br> <align="left">Travel to X0 Y0 at a height above the part. Verify location matches the 

Orientation Error
<b>Error:</b> <br> <align="left">Stock is fixtures at an orientation different than the CAM program. 
<b>Consequence: </b> <br>
<b> Mitigation: </b> <br><align="left"> Review GCode.  <br> \u2022 Locate Z positions. <br> \u2022 Negative Z positions indicate a stock top reference.  <br> \u2022 Positive Z positions reference friom stock bottom.

WCS & Indicating Disconnect
<b>Error:</b> <br><align="left"> Wrong Z0 referenced. Swapped top of stock & bottom of stock as Z0 reference.
<b> Consequence:</b> <br><align="left"> No part engagement/cutting air 
<b> Mitigation: </b> <br> <align="left">Review GCode. <br> \u2022 Locate Z positions. <br> \u2022 Negative Z positions indicate a stock top reference. <br> \u2022 Positive Z positions reference friom stock bottom.

Z Zero Reference 
<b> Error:</b> <br> <align="left"> Wrong Z0 referenced. Swapped top of stock & bottom of stock as Z0 reference.
<b>Consequence:</b> <br><align="left"> No part engagement/cutting air 
<b>Mitigation:</b> <br> <align="left"> Review GCode.  <br> \u2022 Locate Z positions. <br> \u2022 Negative Z positions indicate a stock top reference.  <br> \u2022 Positive Z positions reference from stock bottom.


%% Fixturing Errors
Fixture Toolpath Collision 
<b>Error:</b> <br> Fixture located in the way of the toolpath
<b>Consequence:</b> <br> <align="left"> The tool will crash into the fixture. <br> \u2022 The tool will likely break and the fixture will be damaged.<br> \u2022 Damage to the machine is also possible. 
<b>Mitigation:</b> <br> <align="left"> Test the toolpath above & to the side of the fixture so the tool does not engage any material. 
For complex fixtures, the fixture should be modeled into the CAM process. Simulate any tool collisions. 

Insufficient Clamping
<b>Error:</b> <br> The selected fixture does not apply enough pressure to prevent the stock from moving.
This is caused by not having enough surface area clamped
<b> Consequence:</b> <br> The part moves and part must be scrapped. Very insufficient clamping can create a safety concern.
<b>Mitigation:</b><br> Clamp two sides of the stock or at least 3 contact points for cylindrical parts. 
A bump test with a rubber mallet should not visibly move the part. 

Parallelism Errors
<b>Error:<b><br> Stock is not seated flush on the table. 
<b>Cause:</b> <br> Machining chips are in between the stock and vice, parralels were not used, 
<b>Consequence:<b><br> Machining plane and stock are not parralel 
<b>Mitigation:</b><br> Clean the stock and fixture of any chips that could offset part. <br> Use parralels in the vice. <br> Tap part downward with a mallet to make sure part is completly seated. 

%% Tool Length Offset Errors
Incorrect Tool
<b>Error:</b><br> Wrong tool in toolholder
<b>Consequence: </b><br>If real tool < offset, tool cuts air. Real tool length > offset, tool will crash into the part or take a  larger cut.
<align="left">
<b>Mitigation:<b><br> When tool is created or modified: :<br> 1. Move the tool to a given Z position well above the table/established Z 0 position.<br> Compare the distance between Z0 reference and the tool. :<br> Values should be equal, if correct.  

Incorrect Tool Length Data
<b>Error:<b></br>Toollength has changed. Adjustments have been made and offset length is outdated
<b>Consequence: </b><br>If real tool < offset, tool cuts air. Real tool length > offset, tool will crash into the part or take a  larger cut.
Depending on mangnitude of the error, the tool may also crash with the table or fixture under the stock. 
<b>Mitigation:<b><br> When tool is created or modified: :<br> 1. Move the tool to a given Z position well above the table/established Z 0 position.<br> Compare the distance between Z0 reference and the tool. :<br> Values should be equal, if correct.  

Measurement Error
Error: Measurement process referenced incorrect distances
<b>Consequence: </b><br>If real tool < offset, tool cuts air. Real tool length > offset, tool will crash into the part or take a  larger cut.
Depending on mangnitude of the error, the tool may also crash with the table or fixture under the stock. 
<b>Mitigation:<b><br> When tool is created or modified: :<br> 1. Move the tool to a given Z position well above the table/established Z 0 position.<br> Compare the distance between Z0 reference and the tool. :<br> Values should be equal, if correct.
