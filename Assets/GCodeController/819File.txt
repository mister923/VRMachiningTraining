	Work Coordinate System Alignment				0.2	0	0	0			
	Work Coordinate System Alignment is the process of establishing the relative position of the stock material to the machine.										
	Learning Objective: Given the milling machine, fixtures, stock, and endmill, and edgefinder:  Establish an X & Y axis origin in alignment with the stock. The accuracy of the origin should be within .001” in.				0.2	0	0	0			
	Note: The following Work Coordinate System uses a Edge Finder.	EdgefinderTH			0.2	0	0	0	EdgefinderTH		
	The edgefinder is used to precisely indicate off the stock and locate the edges of the stock. 	EdgefinderTH			0.2	0	0	0			
	The probe is the lower, movable portion of the tool. This edgefinder is placed in a tool holder for use.	TIP			0.2	0	0	0

	Slowly continue to move the edge finder to the side of the stock. As the probe and stock contact, the rotation will appear more concentric.				0.2	0.1525	0	-0.3			
	Continue very incrementally (.0005” ) until the edge finder probe pops out of concentricity. This is the indication that the tool has come in contact with the edge. 				0.2	0.15	0	-0.3	XZero

	Tool  Length Offset Procedure: Tool Setter Method				0.2	0	0	0

	Note: The toolsetter is a specialized measurement tool and is calibrated to measure the distance from the bottom of the tool setter to the top of the pressure measurement pad.	ToolOffsetter	ToolOffsetter	ToolIOffsetterPath	0.2	0	0	0			
	Place the desired end mill in the collet and affix the drawbar to clamp the endmill.	EndmillTH			0.2	0	0	0			
	Place the tool setter on the top of the stock in a stable, flat region.	ToolOffsetter	ToolOffsetter	OffsetterPath	0.2	0	0	0	ToolOffsetter		
	Calibrate the tool setter following the included instructions. The tool setter should read 0.000” when it is extended a total distance of 2.000”, from the base of the tool setter to the pressure pad.				0.2	0	0	0			
	Lower the tool until the pressure pad of the tool setter and the endmill are just touching.				0.2	0	0	-0.865			
	Very slowly (.001” increments) lower the tool (CNC) until the tool depresses the tool setter until it reads 0.000” or a value slightly under.				0.05	0	0	-0.9			
	Zero the axis when the tool offsetter reads 0.000.				0.2	0	0	0	ZZeroButton		
	Alternatively, set the Z position by entering the value after G92. G92 is the G-code command for setting axis position.				0.2	0	0	0

	Fixturing				0.2	0	0	0			
					0.2	0	0	0			
	The fixturing process will vary for each part. Different sizes & shapes of parts will have different requirements.				0.2	0	0	0			
	A vice is the most common form of fixturing.				0.2	0	0	0			
	A vice can be used and adjusted for a wide range of stock. 				0.2	0	0	0			
	First, clean the vice of any oil or metal chips. 				0.2	0	0	0			
	Place square stock in the center of the vice. 				0.2	0	0	0			
	If the stock does not clear the top of the vice, parralels can be used to elevate the stock. 				0.2	0	0	0			
	Alternate fixturing may be required for more complex parts. For example:<br> \u2022 Circular Stock <br> \u2022 Perimeter Needs To Be Machined <br> \u2022 Large Stock				0.2	0	0	0			
	There are three common requirements for all fixtures::<br> \u2022 1. Sufficient clamping force:<br> \u2022 2. Will not collide with the tool:<br> \u2022 3. Fixture provides access to area being machined.				0.2	0	0	0			
	For repetitive machining, efficient processes are very important. A vice stop can be used to maintain a similar reference point. 				0.2	0	0	0
